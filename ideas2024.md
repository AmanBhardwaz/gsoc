# GSoC 2024 Ideas for RUXAILAB (yes, we have updated our name after paper publications)

All the current ideas for GSoC2024 are listed bellow:

### Eye Tracking Algorithm Optimization (350h)
This project focuses on optimizing existing eye tracking algorithms to improve their efficiency and accuracy. The optimization will involve exploring new approaches, fine-tuning parameters, and implementing enhancements using Javascript for the front-end. The goal is to create a more robust and responsive eye tracking system that can be seamlessly integrated into various applications.

We would like that the eye tracking algorithm develop works on real time. We want it to be integrated with RUXAILAB project to perform usability tests.

### Implementation of Card Sorting method on RUXAILAB (175h)

**Description:**
This project aims to implement a novel usability analysis method based on card sorting, a research technique involving the categorization and organization of information through user collaboration. Card sorting allows understanding how users group related information and concepts, providing valuable insights for designing more intuitive and effective interfaces.

**Keywords:**
Usability, Card Sorting, Interface Design, User Experience, User Research, Usability Analysis.

**Expected Outcome:**
- Development and implementation of a card sorting process tailored to the project's specific needs.
- Collection and analysis of data resulting from the card sorting sessions.
- Detailed report of the obtained results, including insights into identified grouping patterns, recommendations for design improvements, and suggestions for optimizing user experience.

**Skills Required:**
- Proficiency in interface design and user experience.
- Familiarity with user research methods, particularly card sorting.
- Ability to analyze qualitative data.
- Strong communication and writing skills to document and present the project's results.

# GSoc 2021 Ideas for Uramaki Lab

All the current ideas for GSoC2021 are listed bellow:

### Implementation of an Open Source tool based on usability remote testing
***Keywords:** Remote Usability Testing, Usability Laboratory.*

The world wide situation caused by COVID-19 affected several areas of knowledge and changed the world as it was known. For this reason we are forced to seek new strategies and ways to perform works that were done into a face-to-face environment to remote ones.
Usability testing LAB. fits with this premise and for these reasons it should be addressed to relearn what was done in local environments and change to new paradigms that remote systems could offer. This work will be focused on the development of a set of tools that will provide the foundations of an open source community that helps to develop the future of the usability LABs.

### Continue development of an eye tracking recognition system
***Keywords:** Artificial Inteligence (AI), Accessibility, Javascript, Front-end.*

Eye tracking is a sensor technology that makes it possible for a computer or other device to know where a person is looking. An eye tracker can detect the presence, attention and focus of the user. It allows for unique insights into human behavior and facilitates natural user interfaces in a broad range of devices. The ability to control a computer using the eyes is also vital for people who are unable to speak or use their hands. 
There are a number of methods for measuring eye movement. The most popular are optical methods, in which light, typically infrared, is reflected from the eye and sensed by a camera or some other specially designed optical sensor. This project aims to research already existing eye tracking algorithms to see their boundaries and differences to start developing an own existing algorithm using js for a front-end system.

### Face recognition system detection applied to the study of usability tests
***Keywords:** Artificial Inteligence (AI), Sentimental Analysis, Journey Maps, Research.*

Tons of technologies are used to evaluate psychology emotions on the study of usability tests. Heart rates, sweat gland activities, brainwaves, but those mentioned require precise and expensive sensors tools. As a cheaper system we found the face recognition systems and in a more specific way facial recognition or sentimental analysis. Although it is not a perfect system because it does not work properly with subtle emotions, it is a great system for expressive emotions. With the aim to introduce sentimental analysis into the UX remote LAB tool, we are seeking for a method that integrates sentimental analysis with the other different tools developed in order to create user journey maps that could provide more insights than working separately.

### UX applied to new user interfaces
***Keywords:** User Experience (UX), User Interfaces (UIs), Heuristics, Reasearch.*

Every year, new trends develop in user interface design that literally changes the face of the Internet for years to come. Some of these trends are just starting to emerge, while others grow more popular each year. 
When we talk about user interface (UI) in computing, we’re referring to how a computer program or system represents itself to its user, usually via graphics, text and sound. 
Those UI, involved the use of touch (e.g. Smartphones), voice (e.g. Siri) and even gestures (e.g. Microsoft Kinect) and other more complex could be those that mixtures the reality and the virtual space like virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR).
This work is focused to find new heuristics methods that can be applied to these new UI with the focus on voice user interfaces (VUI), VR and AR systems.

###  Integration of heat maps into Remote Usability LAB.
***Keywords:** Artificial Inteligence (AI), Remote Usability Testing, Development.*

Heat map is an umbrella term for different heat mapping tools: scroll maps, click maps, and move maps. Knowing the difference is handy, as each type helps you investigate a slightly different aspect of your website performance.
The aim of this project is to develop and integrate a tool that allows to record the different heat maps inside.

---

### Scroll Maps
***Keywords:** Artificial Inteligence (AI), Remote Usability Testing, Development.*

Scroll maps show you the exact percentage of people who scroll down to any point on the page: the redder the area, the more visitors saw it. 
The aim of this IC is to find and research similar tools that allow to create this kind of map, explore them and compare them. 
After initial research, the data will be used to start the analysis of the requirements. Collected data will be used to start developing an own heat scroll map tool.

---

### Click Maps
***Keywords:** Artificial Inteligence (AI), Remote Usability Testing, Development.*

Click maps show you an aggregate of where visitors click their mouse on desktop devices and tap their finger on mobile devices (in this case, they are known as touch heatmaps). The map is color-coded to show the elements that have been clicked and tapped the most (red, orange, yellow). After researching similar methods that use the same protocol, it will be developed a new one and compared with the others.

---


### Move Maps
***Keywords:** Artificial Inteligence (AI), Remote Usability Testing, Development.*

Move maps track where desktop users move their mouse as they navigate the page. The hot spots in a move map represent where users have moved their cursor on a page, and research suggests a correlation between where people are looking and where their mouse is—meaning that a move map gives you an indication of where people might be looking as they go through your page. After researching similar methods that use the same protocol, it will be developed a new one and compared with the others.

### Evaluation emotional responses on usability tests
***Keywords:** Artificial Inteligence (AI), Remote Usability Testing, Research.*

The role of emotion as a component of user experience has been pointed out in the HCI literature. Exploration of these emotional responses could provide additional insight into the user experience when it is combined with different methods like Heath Maps. We are looking for a methodology that can combine verbal and nonverbal emotion during usability tests with users.

### Voice Design UX
***Keywords:** IoT, Remote Usability, Heuristics, Research.*

New methods of user interaction raised in the past few years. Voice is one of those who have grown due to the increase of the IoT products like Alexa, Google Home or Siri. For this reason new usability patterns should be addressed to guide new interactions with the users following principles or heuristics. 
It should be studied how it is actually done and how it could be introduced into a virtual LAB. The scope of this IC is to create and analyze new heuristics that could be addressed for future VUI.

### Virtual Reality UX
***Keywords:** User Experience (UX), Remote Usability, Research.*

New methods of user interaction raised in the past few years. Virtual Reality or VR is one of those who have grown during the last years. With the integration on the mobile systems it has grown in popularity and nowadays it is accessible for the main range of smartphone users.
The study will be focused to analyze the current UX reports that are being done into VR system and how it could be introduced into a virtual LAB.

### Augmented Reality UX
***Keywords:** User Experience (UX), Remote Usability, Research.*

New methods of user interaction raised in the past few years. Augmented Reality or AR is one of those who have grown during the last years. With the integration on the mobile systems it has grown in popularity and nowadays it is accessible for the main range of smartphone users.
The study will be focused to analyze the current UX reports that are being done into AR system and how it could be introduced into a virtual LAB.

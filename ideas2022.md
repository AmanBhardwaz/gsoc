# GSoC 2022 Ideas for Uramaki Lab

All the current ideas for GSoC2022 are listed bellow:



### Refactor User Testing workflow and layout (350h)
***Keywords:** Remote Usability Testing, Usability Laboratory.*

The world wide situation caused by COVID-19 affected several areas of knowledge and changed the world as it was known. For this reason we are forced to seek new strategies and ways to perform works that were done into a face-to-face environment to remote ones.
Usability testing LAB. fits with this premise and for these reasons it should be addressed to relearn what was done in local environments and change to new paradigms that remote systems could offer. This work will be focused on the development of a set of tools that will provide the foundations of an open source community that helps to develop the future of the usability LABs.

**Expected outcome:** Improvement and new features defined between mentor and collaborator on the remote usabillity lab project

**Skills required:** Vuejs, Javascript, Firebase.

**Possible mentors:**  TBA (Brazil)

**Difficulty:** Medium

### Integration of an eye tracking recognition system (175h)
***Keywords:** Artificial Inteligence (AI), Accessibility, Javascript, Front-end.*

Eye tracking is a sensor technology that makes it possible for a computer or other device to know where a person is looking. An eye tracker can detect the presence, attention and focus of the user. It allows for unique insights into human behavior and facilitates natural user interfaces in a broad range of devices. The ability to control a computer using the eyes is also vital for people who are unable to speak or use their hands. 
There are a number of methods for measuring eye movement. The most popular are optical methods, in which light, typically infrared, is reflected from the eye and sensed by a camera or some other specially designed optical sensor. This project aims to research already existing eye tracking algorithms to see their boundaries and differences to keep up developing an own existing algorithm using js for a front-end system.

**Expected outcome:** Improvement on the web eye tracker project. Milestones defined by collaborator and mentor.

**Skills required:** Vuejs, Python, Flask, TensorflowJS, SKLearn and Firebase

**Possible mentors:** TBA

**Difficulty:** Medium

###  Integration of heat maps into Remote Usability LAB. (175h)
***Keywords:** Artificial Inteligence (AI), Remote Usability Testing, Development.*

Heat map is an umbrella term for different heat mapping tools: scroll maps, click maps, and move maps. Knowing the difference is handy, as each type helps you investigate a slightly different aspect of your website performance.
The aim of this project is to develop and integrate a tool that allows to record the different heat maps inside.

**Expected outcome:** A tool capable of analysisng a website performance by using different heatmaps strategies

**Skills required:** No special skills required

**Possible mentors:** TBA (Colombia)

**Difficulty:** Easy

### Scroll Maps (175h)
***Keywords:** Artificial Inteligence (AI), Remote Usability Testing, Development.*

Scroll maps show you the exact percentage of people who scroll down to any point on the page: the redder the area, the more visitors saw it. 
The aim of this project is to find and research similar tools that allow to create this kind of map, explore them and compare them. 
After initial research, the data will be used to start the analysis of the requirements. Collected data will be used to start developing an own heat scroll map tool.

**Expected outcome:** An implementation of a scroll map based on user interaction in a website

**Skills required:** No special skills required

**Possible mentors:** TBA (Spain)

**Difficulty:** Easy

### Click Maps (175h)
***Keywords:** Artificial Inteligence (AI), Remote Usability Testing, Development.*

Click maps show you an aggregate of where visitors click their mouse on desktop devices and tap their finger on mobile devices (in this case, they are known as touch heatmaps). The map is color-coded to show the elements that have been clicked and tapped the most (red, orange, yellow). After researching similar methods that use the same protocol, it will be developed a new one and compared with the others.

**Expected outcome:** An implementation of a click map based on user interaction in a website

**Skills required:** No special skills required

**Possible mentors:** TBA (Argentina)

**Difficulty:** Easy

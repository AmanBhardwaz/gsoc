# GSOC-2021

<ABOUT THE ORG>

## Before the application

Before applying directly to Google Summer of Code Dashboard we recommend you to get in touch with our community. Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/HrkNfE5c), introduce yourself, ask questions about the projects, get in touch with mentors and learn how you can start contributing to the Uramaki LAB project. If you don't have a discord or prefer to send an e-mail you can contact us at `uramakilab@gmail.com `. 

In our organization we value the people who are pro active, hardworking and that sees always the big picture, thinking about how their work can contribute to the community and to the open source world, thus it is a good idea to start colaborating with us early so we can get to know you better.


 ## Suggested knowledge
 
 We suggest you to have at least a basic knowledge on some or all of the technologies below.
 
 * Javascript
 * Vue.js
 * MongoDB
 * Flutter
 * Python

We don't expect you to be familiar with all the projects code, as you have enough time to learn about it during the bonding period, but if you are already familiar or has contributed you will have extra points.

## How to apply
  
 
## Ideas page

Check out our project's ideas on the [Ideas Page](), see if you find something that catches your attention. If you don't get interested in one of the proposals or has another idea that you want to make, validade it with one of the mentors before submitting your proposal.


#### We'll be waiting for you, Good Luck!!! :D
